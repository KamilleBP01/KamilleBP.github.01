    <h1> My name is Kamille Patrick.</h1>
    <p> My name is Kamille Patrick and I am a Student Athlete at Shaw University. Iâ€™ve been playing volleyball for almost 11-12 years and I throw for the Track & Field team. I am a Senior majoring in Business Management with a minor in Accounting and Computer Info Systems.
         I plan to become a future business owner and/or entrepreneur. But I recently got the interest of coding so maybe I might change and try to dive into the Tech Industry! 
         I love competition and being competitive. Working towards a goal is very simple to me because that is usually what I am doing everyday. I know what it takes to truly want something for yourself because I won the 2022 CIAA Track & Field Championship for Javelin!
         But with that being said, as much as I am competitive, I am very easy to cooperate with. I understand how it feels to make sacrifices and to think outside of the box to complete a goal or to come to a certain point.

        I love to spend time with my friends, grab a bite to eat and just to explore to find new hobbies and interests! Here's some pictures that I think represents me!
